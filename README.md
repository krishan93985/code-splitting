## What I Learned

Implemented component based code splitting using: 
1. React.lazy() method which provides dynamic lazy loading of any component using import('') returning promises.
2. Applying React.Suspense to show a fallback

## Use

-when main bundle size is large, splitting into chunks and serving while needed improves performance.
